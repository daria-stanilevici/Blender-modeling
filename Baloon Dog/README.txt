As a child, I always wanted to learn how to make balloon animals. 
I remember going to fairs and watching in amazement as the balloon artists twisted and turned colourful balloons into all sorts of creatures😄🐶

But try as I might, I could never quite figure it out. I would end up with a tangled mess of rubber and a deflated balloon.

Fast forward to today, as a 3D artist, I decided to take matters into my own hands and create a dog balloon using Blender🤩🙌

Never give up on your dreams!💫
