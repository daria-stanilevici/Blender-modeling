The model of the ramen bowl was created with great attention to detail, from the textures of the noodles to the individual ingredients that make up the dish. 
The broth is rich and savory, while the slices of pork, green onions, and other toppings add a burst of flavor and color. 
The chopsticks resting on the bowl complete the realistic presentation of this iconic Japanese dish.

This project was a challenging but rewarding one, as it required a combination of technical skill and creativity. 
From sculpting the noodles and adding textures to the different components of the dish, to positioning the elements in the scene,
this project pushed me to explore different aspects of 3D modeling and rendering.
