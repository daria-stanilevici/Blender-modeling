Cute and scrumptious red jelly with cherries and whipped cream on top!

Just Blender and 15 minutes. While it may have been a quick project, I am very happy with the results and think it turned out adorable.

As a 3D artist, it's important to not only showcase complex and time-consuming projects but also to highlight the beauty in simplicity.

Sometimes, even the smallest of projects can make a big impact!
