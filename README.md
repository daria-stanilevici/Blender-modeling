Welcome to my Blender repository!

Here, you will find a collection of my personal works created using Blender, a 3D modeling that I enjoy doing as a hobby in my spare time.

In this repository, you'll find a variety of my Blender creations, from simple models to more complex scenes and animations. I am passionate about exploring and creating in the world of 3D graphics and animation, and Blender has become one of my favorite tools for bringing my ideas to life. Whether I'm sculpting characters, designing environments, or experimenting with new techniques, I always strive to learn and improve my skills with each project.

if you appreciate my work and would like to support me or collaborate on a project, please feel free to reach out to me via email at dstanilevichi@gmail.com. 
I am always open to new ideas and partnerships in the world of 3D graphics, and any contributions or feedback are greatly appreciated.
